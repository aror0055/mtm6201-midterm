            About Us
        </h3>
        <p>
            The frozen spoon was founded by our CEO Ms. Lauren Jarett who started working from home as a side for two years, this career choice was working out as a better option, she was happier as an entrepreneur so she decided to focus on the ice cream store full-time. 5 years ago, she managed to start her business out of a small kitchen in Hinton Avenue. As she progressed in her entrepreneurial career, she decided to open The Frozen Spoon in the heart of the City, Elgin Street. Today, The Frozen Spoon is ready and excited to bring the goodness of our ice cream which is made of 100% locally sourced ingredients that are produced by using environment friendly methods of production.
